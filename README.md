# deep-super-resolution-for-fluid-flows

This is a research project aiming to enhance the resolution of fluid flow images using physics-informed neural networks.

Our contribution corresponds to the P-SwinIR model which builds on top of the SwinIR architecture and includes physics laws in the loss function.
